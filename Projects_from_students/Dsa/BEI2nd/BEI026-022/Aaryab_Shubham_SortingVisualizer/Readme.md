# Sorting Visualizer using Python
This is a Sorting Visualizer that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort using Python.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Install the required libraries by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the following command to launch the sorting visualizer: python main.py
- Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the drop-down menu.
- Set the array size and speed of the visualization using the sliders.
- Click the "Generate" button to generate a random array to be sorted.
- Click the "Start" button to visualize the chosen sorting algorithm on the generated array.
## Features
- Visualization of four different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort)
- Sliders to adjust array size and visualization speed
- Random array generation for sorting
- Color-coded bars representing the elements in the array
- Detailed information about the algorithm being visualized
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)
# Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms to the visualization.
- Implement user input to create custom arrays to be sorted.
- Allow users to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms on the same array.
