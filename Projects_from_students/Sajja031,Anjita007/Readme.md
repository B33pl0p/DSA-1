# Hangman
## A simple game of Hangman in C
It is a word guessing game where the player has to guess a word by suggesting letters.
The player has a limited number of attempts (6) to guess the word.
In each attempt, the player inputs a letter, and if the letter is present in the word, the program reveals the positions where that letter is present. 
If the letter is not present in the word, a body part of the man appears and the game proceeds. 
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or exceeds the maximum number of attempts.
